# My exercism solutions

Keeping track of the solutions I submitted to exercism

## What is it?

I'm trying to improve my ruby skills solving some of the challenges in [exercism](https://exercism.io).

I really like the idea of having real humans (mentors) reviewing my code

### Why is it public?

I'm always working on different machines, and i never know when I have to work on an exercise, so I like to have it on github.

### Should you use it?

Probably not, you can already see on the website solutions that are much better than mine
